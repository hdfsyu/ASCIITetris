# ASCIITetris
This is a part of the ASCII series!
# Compiling & Running
Sadly, this only works on windows, because of windows.h, so if someone can convert the game for POSIX systems and maybe send a pull request that would be cool
## Compiling
### Deps
Visual Studio, C/C++ Support
### Instructions
Click on "Local Windows Debugger" or head to Build > Compile in Visual Studio
## Running
### Deps
Same deps as compiling
### Instructions
Press the green run button to run the game
# Notes
Controls are Z for rotation, and arrow keys are for moving the tetris piece
There is a known bug where the top row of the playing field is shifted to the right a little bit, I cannot for the life of me fix this bug so someone is gonna have to submit a pull request to fix it
This runs completely in the terminal, Enjoy!
